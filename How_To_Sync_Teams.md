5. You can now view and sync files from the Team in Explorer. In the right hand pane, look for a new group called "Althouse & Meade, Inc" with an icon of an office building. You should see all your synced projects here. Note: This is separate from OneDrive, which is cloud storage tied to your account only.

6. An empty cloud icon means the file lives on the cloud and needs to be downloaded before you can use it. Simply double clicking will start this process. Two arrows in a circle indicate that syncing is happening. A green checkmark means the file is downloaded locally and up to date.
